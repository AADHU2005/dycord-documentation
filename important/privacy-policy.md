{% hint style="info" %}
These data are stored when enabled and can be removed when disabled
{% endhint %}

## Updating Data

The data may be updated when using specific commands. Updating data will require the input of an end user, and data that can be seen as sensitive, such as content of a message, may need to be stored when using certain commands.

No other actions may update the stored information at any given time.

## Temporarily stored Information

The Bot may keep the stored information in an internal caching mechanic for a certain amount of time. (command usage) After this time period, the cached information will be dropped and only be re-added when required.

## The Owner

Your data is stored in our highly secure database. The access to the database is restricted to the owner of **Dycord**.

## Removal of Data

Stored Data can be removed automatically through means of removing the bot from a Server. This can be achieved by either kicking or banning the bot from the server. If you want to have it removed without kicking/banning the bot from your server, you have the rights to request the developers to do so. Once deleted, it is not possible to recover back.

Additionally, if you would like to request for removal or have any concerns, contact Our [Support Server](https://discord.gg/wM7RVuSbvs)
